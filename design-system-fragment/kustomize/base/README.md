## Configuration base

This folder contains the base configuration for the
fragment. That is, it contains the vast majority of the
settings for the Deployment, basic environment variables
and a Service definition. 

It is most likely not deployable without the 
overlay-specific overrides, but it doesn't have to be.
It's just a bonus if it is.
