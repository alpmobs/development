    # Design Tokens
    <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens are the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — color, spacing, line heights, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data.</p>

      # Overview
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens are a set of specific values or variables that define the visual design properties of a user interface. They are typically defined as a collection of key-value pairs that store information such as colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements that are used across an entire design system. </p>

      # Why use design tokens?
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens are an essential component of a design system. It is used to define the visual style of the components and to ensure consistency across all products and platforms.</p>
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Here are some of the key reasons why design tokens are used in a design system:</p>
      - **Consistency**
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens help ensure that all design elements are consistent across different products and platforms. By defining a set of tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and other design properties, designers can maintain a consistent visual style across all components.</p>
      - **Scalability**
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">As a product or organization grows, it can become difficult to maintain consistency in the design. Design tokens help to scale a design system by providing a standardized approach to design that can be easily updated and reused across multiple projects.</p>
      - **Flexibility**
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens provide flexibility in the design system by allowing for easy changes to the visual style of components. Changes can be made at the token level, and those changes will be automatically applied throughout the system.</p>
      - **Collaboration**
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens help bridge the gap between designers and developers, enabling them to work together more effectively. Designers can define design tokens, and developers can use those tokens to create the code that powers the design.</p>
      - **Accessibility**
      <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Design tokens can be used to ensure that all components in a design system meet accessibility guidelines. Tokens can be defined for color contrast, font sizes, and other accessibility-related properties to ensure that all users can access the product.</p>

      # Types of design tokens
      <img class="sb-img" src="design-token-types.png" />
      In Spark, we categorize tokens into two distinct types:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">**Brand Tokens**</p>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">These tokens store fundamental values that can be reused throughout your brand's design elements.</p>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">They are directly usable and are automatically inherited by other token types.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">**Purpose Tokens**</p>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Purpose tokens are linked to Brand tokens and serve to convey the specific intention or purpose of a token.</p>
          <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Names for Purpose tokens can vary from broad, encompassing various design elements, to very specific, targeting a particular component's purpose.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      # How to read tokens?
      Being familiar with token names can speed up your ability to locate the correct token while working on designs and coding.
      <img class="sb-img sb-img-s" src="design-token-breakdown.png" />
      <ol>
        <li>
          **Namespace:** In a design system, all token names begin with the **name of the system**, such as `spk` which stands for Spark.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Object:** Refers to tokens specific to a **component**, **element within a component**, or a **component group**.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Base:** Tokens backbone that combines **category**, **concept**, and **property**. It could be visual styles like color, typography, font-size, background, shadow and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Modifier:** Refers to one or more **variant**, **state**, **scale** and **mode**.
        </li>
      </ol>

      # Using Spark design token in a fragment
      To utilize and implement tokens in your code, follow these steps:
      - Choose the design tokens that best suit your needs.
      - Replace the old brand fragment color variables or other style values with the updated design token variables.

      # Best practices
      When working with design tokens, it's essential to select tokens that emphasize semantic meaning over specific values. This ensures that your design system remains adaptable and comprehensible, fostering consistency and clarity in your design and development processes.
